# Project 1 - Space Invaders

## Project Overview

For the first project of the SEI, the task was to make a fully functioning game from a list of ten classic arcade games. This was to be a browser game utilising HTML, CSS and JavaScript and had to be completed within a week.

For my first major project as a software engineer in training, I chose to put my own twist on the 80s arcade classic, Space Invaders.

Named "Marauder_Musk", this game is set in 2066, after the successful colonisation of Mars and the founding of the presently fictional city of Nüwa.

Using the base rules of the original game, the objective is simple. Defend Nüwa by clearing the Andromedan armada or face a successful invasion, resulting in a game loss.

## Controls

Once on the landing page, click **Enter the Game** to be taken to the game page. After the player has read the animated story, they may proceed to clicking **Start Game**. The player may only move **left** and **right**, whilst the alien fleet are able to meander down the page, firing lasers towards the player in the process. To engage the missiles, the player can press **spacebar**

## Initial Approach to Brief

Once I had decided to build a version of Space Invaders, I started planning out a basic over view of the game using written notes and pseudocode. I began with writing out the basic logic of the game in short statements, whilst also elaborating on which methods I might use in order to accurately achieve this. Below is an example of some of the pseudocode planning.

## Day 1

After the planning phase was complete, I decided to start by creating the basic 'play-zone' for the game. As this is a grid based game, I needed to set a few constants such as `height`, `width` and `cellCount`. By setting these to variables, it makes changing the size of the grid dynamic and therefore no need to re-write code.
